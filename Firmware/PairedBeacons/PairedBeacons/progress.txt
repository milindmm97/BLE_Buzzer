Have placed the folders on ideal directories

Bellow error accurs : undefined reference to `__RAM1_segment_end__'

Next actions : 

	To see how to fix this
		Best would be to just replace those flash and emproject files from the newer SDK and change the paths and configs
	
	To move BLE codes to the ideal file in ble_central and ble_peripheral dirs

	To move security otp generation from central to peripheral

	To implement fstorage and test it

	To test all the functionality
